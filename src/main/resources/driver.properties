user=Database user name
password=Password of database user
database=Database
socketFactory=to use a custom socket factory, set it to the full name of the class that implements javax.net.SocketFactory.
connectTimeout=The connect timeout value, in milliseconds, or zero for no timeout.
pipe=On Windows, specify named pipe name to connect.
localSocket=Permits connecting to the database via Unix domain socket, if the server allows it. The value is the path of Unix domain socket (i.e "socket" database parameter : select @@socket)
tcpKeepAlive=Sets corresponding option on the connection socket.
tcpAbortiveClose=This option can be used in environments where connections are created and closed in rapid succession. Often, it is not possible to create a socket in such an environment after a while, since all local �ephemeral� ports are used up by TCP connections in TCP_WAIT state. Using tcpAbortiveClose works around this problem by resetting TCP connections (abortive or hard close) rather than doing an orderly close. It is accomplished by using socket.setSoLinger(true,0) for abortive close
localSocketAddress=Hostname or IP address to bind the connection socket to a local (UNIX domain) socket.
socketTimeout=Defined the network socket timeout (SO_TIMEOUT) in milliseconds. Value of 0 disables this timeout. Default: 0ms.
allowMultiQueries=permit multi-queries like insert into ab (i) values (1); insert into ab (i) values (2). Default: false.

sslMode=Indicate SSL demand. Possible value disable, trust (no certificate and hostname validation), verify-ca (Encryption, certificates validation, BUT no hostname verification), verify-full (Standard SSL use: Encryption, certificate validation and hostname)
enabledSslCipherSuites=Force TLS/SSL cipher (comma separated list). Example : "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
sessionVariables=<var>=<value> pairs separated by comma, mysql session variables, set upon establishing successful connection.
tinyInt1isBit=Datatype mapping flag, handle TinyInt as BIT(boolean). Default is true.
transformedBitIsBoolean=Indicate for TINYINT in column metadata that type is BOOLEAN in place of BIT. A value of 0 is considered FALSE, non-zero values are considered TRUE. Default is false.
yearIsDateType=Year is date type, rather than numerical.
dumpQueriesOnException=If set to 'true', an exception is thrown during query execution containing a query string.
prepStmtCacheSize=if useServerPrepStmts = true, defines the prepared statement cache size that option `cachePrepStmts` use. Default: 250
useAffectedRows=If false (default), use "found rows" for the row count of statements. This corresponds to the JDBC standard. If true, use "affected rows" for the row count. This changes the behavior of, for example, UPDATE... ON DUPLICATE KEY statements.
useServerPrepStmts=PrepareStatement are prepared on the server side before executing. The applications that repeatedly use the same queries have value to activate this option, but the general case is to use the direct command (text protocol). if rewriteBatchedStatements is set to true, this option will be set to false
connectionAttributes=When performance_schema is active, permit to send server some client information in a key;value pair format (example: connectionAttributes=key1:value1,key2,value2). Those informations can be retrieved on server within tables performance_schema.session_connect_attrs and performance_schema.session_account_connect_attrs. This can permit from server an identification of client/application

pool=Use pool. This option is useful only if not using a DataSource object, but only a connection object. Default: false.
poolName=Pool name that permits identifying threads. default: auto-generated as SingleStore-pool-<pool-index>
maxPoolSize=The maximum number of physical connections that the pool should contain. Default: 8.
autocommit=Set default autocommit value on connection initialization. Default: true.
minPoolSize=When connections are removed due to not being used for longer than than "maxIdleTime", connections are closed and removed from the pool. "minPoolSize" indicates the number of physical connections the pool should keep available at all times. Should be less or equal to maxPoolSize.
maxIdleTime=Specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) a connection can stay in the pool in idle state. This parameter can be set to a minimum of 2 seconds. Default: 600 seconds (10 minutes).
registerJmxPool=Register JMX monitoring pools. Default: true.
poolValidMinDelay=When asking a connection to pool, the pool will validate the connection state. "poolValidMinDelay" permits disabling this validation if the connection has been borrowed recently avoiding useless verifications in case of frequent reuse of connections. 0 means validation is done each time the connection is asked. Default: 1000 (in milliseconds).
useResetConnection=When a connection is closed() (given back to pool), the pool resets the connection state. Setting this option, the prepare command will be deleted, session variables changed will be reset, and user variables will be destroyed when the server permits it (>= SingleStore 7.5.2), permitting saving memory on the server if the application make extensive use of variables. Must not be used with the useServerPrepStmts option. Default: false.
serverSslCert=Permits providing server's certificate in DER form, or server's CA certificate. The server will be added to trustStor. This permits a self-signed certificate to be trusted. Can be used in one of 3 forms : * serverSslCert=/path/to/cert.pem (full path to certificate) * serverSslCert=classpath:relative/cert.pem (relative to current classpath) * or as verbatim DER-encoded certificate string "------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" .
useReadAheadInput=use a buffered inputSteam that read socket available data. This cost a bit more in CPU, but permit returning result-set faster. Default true
cachePrepStmts=enable/disable prepare Statement cache. When enable, PreparedStatement.close won't close prepare immediately, keeping a pool of most used prepared results. Default true.
transactionReplay=When having a failover, can current transaction beeing re-executed, having a completly transparent failover. All commands must be idempotent. Default false.
transactionReplaySize=replay cache buffer maximum size. If a transaction has more command that this size and a failover occurs, transaction will then not be replayed, just throwing an exception error. (Integer) default 64.
