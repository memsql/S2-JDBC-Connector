# SingleStore JDBC Driver

## Version: 1.1.0

SingleStore JDBC Driver is a JDBC 4.2 compatible driver, used to connect applications developed in Java to SingleStore and MySQL databases. SingleStore JDBC Driver is LGPL licensed.

## Obtaining the driver

The driver (jar) can be downloaded from maven :

```script
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.singlestore</groupId>
	<artifactId>singlestore-jdbc-client</artifactId>
	<version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage
To get a connection using SingleStore JDBC Driver, you need a connection string of the following format:
```script
jdbc:singlestore:[replication:|loadbalance:|sequential:]//<hostDescription>[,<hostDescription>...]/[database][?<key1>=<value1>[&<key2>=<value2>]] 
```
The full list of parameters that can be used in the connection string is coming soon

Example:
```script
"jdbc:singlestore://localhost:3306/test?user=root&password=myPassword"
```

You can then get a connection by using the [Driver manager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html) class:
```script
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:singlestore://localhost:3306/test?user=root&password=myPassword");
Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();

ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT NOW()");
rs.next();
System.out.println(rs.getTimestamp(1));
```

Another way to get a connection with SingleStore JDBC Driver is to use a connection pool.
* `SingleStorePoolDataSource` is an implementation that maintains a pool of connections. When a new connection is requested, one is borrowed from the pool.
* `SingleStoreDataSource` is a basic implementation that just returns a new connection each time the `getConnection()` method is called.

Example:
```script
SingleStorePoolDataSource pool = new SingleStorePoolDataSource("jdbc:singlestore://server/db?user=myUser&maxPoolSize=10");

    try (Connection connection = pool.getConnection()) {
        try (Statement stmt = connection.createStatement()) {
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT NOW()");
            rs.next();
            System.out.println(rs.getTimestamp(1));
        }
    }
```

## Building from source

### Requirements
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* Java JDK

Clone the respository:
```script
git clone https://github.com/memsql/S2-JDBC-Connector.git
```

Execute the following from the repository root to build SingleStore JDBC Driver from source:
```script
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip -Dmaven.javadoc.skip package
```

This generates a `singlestore-jdbc-client-<version>.jar` file in `target/` directory.
Install this file to a directory in your `CLASSPATH` to use the driver.
